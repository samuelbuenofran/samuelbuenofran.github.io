## Samuel's GitHub Portofolio

Greetings! This is a GitHub website meant to be used as a portfolio. Organisations, recruiters, and users alike are more than free to take a look around and explore my projects. If there is something of interest that you find then please, do not hesitate to contact me to resolve any doubts, or to get the information that you need. I may not be able to answer all of your inquiries but I will attempt to do my best in doing so. Furthermore, if you do not get a response from me quickly, then that either means I am away or extremely busy completing other tasks.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/samuelbuenofran/samuelbuenofran.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/samuelbuenofran/samuelbuenofran.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
